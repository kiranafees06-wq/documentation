            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its
                        Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                        elements
                        on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                        navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on
                        a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                        database,
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform
                        file
                        manipulations on a server.
                    </li>

                <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are two completely different programming languages, even though they share a
                    similar name. JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that is primarily used
                    for client-side web development. Java is a more robust, compiled programming language that is used
                    in a wide variety of applications.</p>

                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits,
                    temp99, and _name.</p>
